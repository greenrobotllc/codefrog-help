## Quick Start

1. Open CodeFrog and choose **Run Onboarding** to set preferences.
2. Create your first project:
   - **Local Folder** (macOS): Use files on your Mac.
   - **SSH Connection**: Work on a remote server via SSH.
3. Open the **AI** tab and ensure your AI CLI is installed. For Auggie, see [installation guide](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/setup-auggie/install-auggie-cli).
4. Start coding. Use the File Browser, AI Terminal, and Git tools.

- Connect [GitHub](/help/mas/github) for PR comments and issues.
- Review [keyboard shortcuts](/help/mas/shortcuts) for productivity.

## Next Steps
