# Getting Started with CodeFrog

## Quick Start

1. Open CodeFrog and choose **Run Onboarding** to set preferences.
2. Create your first project:
   - **Local Folder** (macOS): Use files on your Mac.
   - **SSH Connection**: Work on a remote server via SSH.
3. Start coding. Use the File Browser, Terminal, and Git tools.

## Recommended Setup

- macOS users: Follow the [macOS Setup Guide](/help/mas/macos-setup) to enable Remote Login and permissions.
- Decide your [workflow](/help/common/workflows): Local or Remote.
- Connect [GitHub](/help/common/github) for PR comments and issues.
- Review [keyboard shortcuts](/help/mas/shortcuts) for productivity.

## Next Steps

- Try [Remote Development](/help/common/workflows#remote-workflow) for server-based projects.
- Learn about [Security Scanning](/help/common/security) and [Security Headers](/help/common/security-headers) to secure your applications.
